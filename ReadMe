GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook to replace the REST approch.

 It has one single endpoint for all kinds of requests, and the method has to be a post request. GraphQL works with types and fields, 
 and it's really powerful since it provides all or just the needed data.

 "Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less."

 - A schema describes the shape of your data graph. It defines a set of types with fields that are populated from your back-end data stores.



 // Packages :

 - koa-graphql : graphql package that will be used as a middleware and allow us to point on schema and resolvers


 // Power of GraphQL : Return not only values but functions
